# Knapsack algorithm with CLI
**My custom powerful** optimization over classic *brute-force* solution.  
+ Searching through whole solution space it **will always find the optimal solution**.  
+ Capable of cutting unpromising branches it **can handle enourmous data sets** as long as given `<CAPACITY>` is small.  

## Contests
+ **Library** includes fast **knapsack implementation** that always **finds optimal solution**.
+ **App** is a simple CLI/stdio **interface to the algorithm**.
